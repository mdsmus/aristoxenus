Xenophilus is a python library to deal with music data. It has a
humdrum parser and code to perform operations on music data.

To use this library the only thing you need is python 2.6 or better,
but if you want to contribute with the development you may want to
setup some tools to run the unit tests and check for code quality:

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools pylint
    sudo easy_install py coverage
